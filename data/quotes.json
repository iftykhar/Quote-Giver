    "The best way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.",
  "Don’t let yesterday take up too much of today.",
  "It’s not whether you get knocked down, it’s whether you get up.",
  "Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.",
  "Your time is limited, don’t waste it living someone else’s life."
